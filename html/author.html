                        A young woman — dark hair, glasses, sweatpants — sits on her rumpled bed and holds a book up to the frame. She’s armed with Post-it notes in case she wants to mark a good quote. A caption informs us she’s never read this author before, so she’s not sure what to expect. Lana Del Rey plays in the background as she curls up in bed with an emotional-support cuddly toy on standby. She opens the book and begins to read. And then emote.
                        <br>
                        She sighs. She gasps. She cries. A lot. She holds her phone close to her face so we can see the individual tears falling. This book is destroying her! We are watching her unravel! The comments are full of readers who say they had the exact same reaction. It’s part of the initiation into the fandom of Colleen Hoover. <br>
                        It’s hard to overstate the staggering popularity of Hoover, known as CoHo to her fans. An immensely prolific writer, she’s released more than two dozen novels and novellas within a decade, both traditionally and self-published. Three of the top 15 books on the “Combined Print & E-Book Fiction” list of New York Times best sellers are hers (that number goes up to seven on the list of trade-paperback fiction.) The Times claims she has sold more than 20 million books. She’s the second-most-followed author on Goodreads, beaten only by Stephen King.

                        She also has more than 1.1 million followers on TikTok; it’s there where she flourishes as a very big deal. While you can’t escape Hoover’s books in bookshops, where they dominate the shelves and have entire tables dedicated to them, her ubiquity is especially pronounced on social media, where reading her has become something of an online rite of passage. If any author has come to represent the staggering and often inexplicable power of social media as a promotional force, it’s Hoover. As an author who rode the wave of self-publishing and adult-oriented coming-of-age narratives in the post-Twilight world, Hoover can easily lay claim to the title of queen of BookTok. In many ways, it feels like the inevitable culmination of her decade in fiction.

                        The typical Hoover book is a story about two people in love (always a cishet romantic pairing, always white) who are burdened by trauma from their pasts; in each one, every emotion is dependably turned up to “extra intense.” She’s written rom-coms, mysteries, and kitchen-sink dramas, but even across genres, you know a Hoover novel when you see it. All the characters have preposterous names like Lowen Ashleigh or Layken Cohen; there’s even a florist named Lily Bloom. Everyone harbors relentless angst and has uniformly excellent sex.

                        In the early 2010s, a new category began to emerge in fiction, one hoping to bridge the gap between what audiences expected from YA (no explicit sex!) and more adult-oriented works. Given the name “new adult” (typically shortened to “NA”), this category allowed the market to take advantage of a literary liminal space, the kind Britney Spears sang about in “I’m Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman.” St. Martin’s Press originated the term when it put out a call for “fiction similar to YA that can be published and marketed as adult — a sort of an ‘older YA’ or ‘new adult.” A group of writers emerged from the indie and self-publishing world as its defining figures, and their work followed a similar pattern: contemporary romances with college-age characters who are deeply impassioned, lead tumultuous lives, and, yes, engage in a lot of hot sex. You never have to wait for the good part in an NA book, which was welcome to readers after Stephenie Meyer spent years promising a sexy wedding night for Edward and Bella but then cut to black.

                        E.L. James, the writer of the 50 Shades series, which popularized BDSM for your mom’s book club, was never sold as a new-adult author per se, but her works operate in a similar space to those that do, and these writers are often grouped together as a result: Anna Todd, a former One Direction–fanfic writer whose After series, centered on a thinly veiled Harry Styles, became a Wattpad sensation and four-part film series.

                <p class="heading name "> Ruskin Bond </p>
                <div class="aboutcontent">
                    <div class="details">
                        Ruskin Bond is an eminent contemporary Indian writer of British descent. He prolifically authored inspiring children’s books and was awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award to honor his work of literature. <br>
                        Born on May 19, 1934, in Kasauli, India, he was the son of Edith Clarke and Aubrey Bond. His father served in the Royal Air Force and frequently moved from places to places along with his son. When he was eight, his parents separated and his mother left him. She married to a Punjabi-Hindu. Bond had a complicated relationship with his mother, who was rarely there to offer him affection and they eventually grew distant. His father’s undivided attention helped him grow. He felt loved and secure but his tragic departure from his life left him lonely and broken. Following the sudden demise of his father, he moved to Dehradun where his grandmother raised him. He received his early education from Bishop Cotton School in Shimla. During his school years he won several writing competitions, including the Hailey Literature Prize and the Irwin Divinity Prize. In 1952, he completed his graduation and moved to England and stayed at his aunt’s house for four years. <br>
                        The first twenty years of his life groomed him to be a good writer as it developed his personality in such a way. Despite his suffering and lonely childhood, Bond developed an optimistic outlook on life. He chose the path of becoming an earnest writer that his father wished him to follow. Therefore, he found solace in reading books that habit was also inculcated in him by his father. Some of his favorite reads include T. E. Lawrence, Charles Dickens, Charlotte Brontë and Rudyard Kipling. <br>

                        At the age of 17 in London, he began to write his first novel, The Room on the Roof. The novel charts the life of an orphaned Anglo-Indian teenager. He runs away to live with his friends as he escapes the tyranny of his strict guardian. The book has a strong autobiographical element as it’s based on his actual experiences living in a small rented room on the roof in Dehradun. It was not published until he was twenty-one. He was awarded John Llewellyn Rhys Memorial prize for his first novel. Its success gave him an impetus to write its sequel Vagrants in the Valley. <br>
                        Subsequently, he returned to India and worked as a journalist in Delhi and Dehradun for a few years. Later, he relocated to a town in the Himalayan foothills, Mussoorie, where he pursued freelance writing since 1963. His essays and articles were published in numerous magazines, such as The Pioneer, The Leader, The Tribune and The Telegraph. Till now he has written over three hundred short stories, essays and novels and over thirty children’s books. Additionally, he penned two autobiographical volumes; Scenes from a Writer’s Life and The Lamp is Lit; Leaves from a Journal. The first one details his formative years in India and the second one is based on journal entries, essay collection and episodes about his years making it as a freelance writer. <br>
                        Some of other notable works of Ruskin Bond include Blue Umbrella, A Flight of Pigeons and Funny Side Up. His works have also been adapted for television and film. A BBC TV-series is based on his debut novel, short story “Susanna’s Seven Husbands” was adapted into a film as 7 Khoon Maaf and film Junoon is inspired by his A Flight of Pigeons.

                <p class="heading name "> Chetan Bhagat </p>
                <div class="aboutcontent">
                    <div class="details">
                        Chetan Baghat, a rising star in the contemporary modern Indian literature, is a multitalented personality. He is a novelist, columnist, public speaker and a screenplay writer. His notable works include Five Point Someone, The 3 Mistakes of My Life and 2 States.Most of his literary works address the issues related to Indian youth and their aspirations which earned Baghat status of the youth icon. <br>
                        On April 22, 1974, in Dehli, India, Baghat was born to a traditional Punjabi bourgeois family. His father served as lieutenant colonel in the Indian army while his mother worked in agricultural department of government. He received most of his education in his hometown. In 1978, he was enrolled in Army Public School and later attended the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi majoring in Mechanical Engineering. Subsequently, he studied at Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad and married a fellow student, Anusha Suryanarayanan, in 1998. Upon graduation, he moved to Hong Kong with his family, where he worked for eleven years with Goldman Sachs as an investment banker. On his return to India, he shifted to Mumbai from New Delhi. With the shift he also switched his career choice and embarked on his passion for writing. <br>
                        While working as a banker he had already began to write manuscripts for his first two novels. His debut novel, Five Point Someone – What not to do at IIT!, was published in 2004. The story is centered on three mechanical engineering students with five point GP at IIT, where the author himself had once studied. It deals with the unfair grading system adopted by the higher education system which places students into higher and lower echelon based on their rote-learning skills. The story is narrated from the first person perspective of one of the friends in a light-hearted tone. Essentially, the book targets the ineffective and uninspiring teaching methods and evaluation system employed by the internationally recognized institutions. The author points out that such institutions merely produce a stock of engineers based on their ability to memorize everything that has been taught rather than encouraging students to tap into their creativity. <br>
                        Five Point Someone instantly became both literary and commercial success. Baghat reached at the zenith of his popularity with his debut that was later turned into a critically acclaimed film titled, 3 Idiots (2009). It was followed by his second equally successful novel, One Night At A Call Center. In fact, it was adapted for big-screen as Hello and Baghat himself wrote the screenplay. However, the adaptation failed to capture audience’s attention and called a flop. In 2008, he penned The 3 Mistakes of My Life, which is based on the all-time favorite Indian sports, cricket. The novel garnered positive reviews and the film adaptation released in 2013, Kai Po Che!, became a hit. <br>
                        Baghat’s fourth novel, 2 States: The Story of My Marriage, is a autobiographical novel that focuses on the prevailing issue of interstate marriage in India. It is based on Baghat’s and his wife’s own experience, who like the protagonist of the novel relentlessly tried to convince their respective families of different casts to approve of their marriage. The book highlights the conservative mindset shared by several sects in Indian states which prohibit marriage outside their cast. The book and its film adaptation was a major success. Baghat wrote two more books; Revolution 2020 (2011), and What Young India Wants (2012). Additionally, he received Society Young Achiever’ award, Publisher’s Recognition award and Filmfare Award for Best Screenplay.
